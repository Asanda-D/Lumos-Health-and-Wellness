# Lumos-Health-and-Wellness-Project
LUMOS is a community-driven initiative focused on improving access to essential health and wellness support services across South Africa. This project aims to develop a digital platform that connects individuals—especially those facing abuse, mental health challenges, or financial hardship—with the resources they need.

The platform will provide:

Easy access to mental health professionals and community therapists

Guidance for individuals seeking help with abusive situations

Information and locations for obtaining essential supplies such as food, sanitary products, and baby diapers

This project prioritizes safety, accessibility, and human dignity by ensuring users can reach out anonymously, find relevant local support, and begin the journey toward healing and stability.
